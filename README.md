 # Mitigation national security risk posed by large language models in AI driven malign information operations 
 #Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project detects whether a given text or news is REAL or FAKE using
Machine Learning techniques. It helps in mitigating AI-driven misinformation.

## Problem Statement
Fake news spreads rapidly on social media and can mislead people.
This system automatically classifies news as real or fake.

## Approach
- Text preprocessing
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Machine Learning Model
- Vectorizer: TF-IDF
- Classifier: Linear SVM (LinearSVC)

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells
3. Enter input text to check whether it is real or fake
